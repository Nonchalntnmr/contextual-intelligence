"""The egress guard — the only path by which personal context reaches a model provider.

Every candidate item passes these checks, in order, and every decision (allowed and
blocked, with a reason code) is written to the audit log before anything is sent:

1. ``secret``                — SECRET never leaves the device.
2. ``not-current``           — superseded, retracted or expired items are not context
                               (temporal correctness enforced twice: here and in memory).
3. ``unconfirmed-instructions`` — text flagged as containing instructions is withheld from
                               every provider until the user confirms it in the dashboard.
4. lineage consent           — the item's own source *and every ancestor's source* must
                               hold an active egress grant for this provider at or above
                               the item's sensitivity.

Passing the guard does not make the content safe to *follow*; the renderer still fences it
as data. The guard decides what the provider may *see*.
