"""Retrieval planning: the model says what it would need to know; CI decides what it may see.

A similarity score cannot tell that "can I drive five kids to the away game" needs the
person's car, or that "what should I order at happy hour" needs "sober since 2019": the
link is an inference, not a resemblance. On the E2 development set, the best of eight local
embedding models put only 81% of needed memories in its top 10 (experiments/e2/CALIBRATION.md).

So before answering, the answering model's vendor is shown the request alone (which it
receives anyway) and writes a few searches for the personal facts that would change a good
answer. CI runs them here, against memory the egress guard already filtered for that
vendor. The vendor sees no memory to plan; it receives only what the searches select.

A remote model that ranked memories itself would have to be sent every allowed memory to
rank, which is naive history by another name. Planning keeps minimization: the model
names what it needs, and CI's local, permissioned retrieval decides what that is.

A planner that fails or replies with something unparseable returns None, and selection
falls back to the unplanned channels (similarity, standing items, recency).
